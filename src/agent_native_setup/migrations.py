"""The migration registry `update` replays before regenerating (RFCs 2026-06-20, 2026-06-22).

Regenerating from the saved config refreshes the files the wizard *generates*, but it can't
move the files a *user* accumulated when a convention's layout changes — e.g. the RFC
lifecycle rename (`current/` → `active/`). Those transforms live here, in an append-only,
version-tagged registry. Each entry declares a ``kind``:

- ``auto`` — a deterministic, **idempotent** move/rename the tool performs. It guards on the
  old layout, so a re-run is a no-op; ``update`` therefore *attempts every ``auto`` step on
  every run* regardless of version (robust even when versions aren't reliably tagged), and
  its ``version`` is informational/ordering only.
- ``agent`` / ``manual`` — a transform that needs a coding agent (to read the user's content)
  or a human. The tool never performs these; it emits their ``instructions`` into the
  ``UPDATING.md`` runbook for the boundaries actually crossed. These are **version-keyed**:
  span selection (``steps_in_span``) picks the ones in ``(installed, latest]``, in order.

By the §1 contract of RFC 2026-06-22, ``auto`` steps may ship in a compatible (minor, or in
0.x a patch) release; ``agent``/``manual`` steps only at a breaking-series boundary.

Earlier versions kept the standard engineering contract — the four execution principles, the

`INSTRUCTION.md` (which `update` keeps fresh from now on), leaving `AGENTS.md` as your
project-specific map.

`update` has already written the new `INSTRUCTION.md`. Reconcile your `AGENTS.md`:

1. Remove the now-duplicated standard sections from `AGENTS.md` — the four numbered
   principles, "When to write an RFC", and "How this project stays agent-native". They live
   in `INSTRUCTION.md` now.
2. Keep everything project-specific: the title, description, the Navigation table, the
   Command surface, and anything you added.
3. Make sure `AGENTS.md` points at `INSTRUCTION.md` near the top — a "Read `INSTRUCTION.md`
   first" line, and (for Claude) an `@INSTRUCTION.md` import.

If you had *edited* any of the standard sections, fold those edits into `INSTRUCTION.md`
(or keep them in `AGENTS.md` as deliberate project overrides) before deleting them above."""
